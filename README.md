Diabetes Prediction Using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Overview
This project aims to predict diabetes presence in individuals using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, a straightforward yet powerful machine learning technique. The dataset originates from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases and involves health-related attributes of Pima Indian women.

Dataset
The dataset comprises 768 instances with the following features:

Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration
BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
SkinThickness: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)
Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
BMI: Body mass index
DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function
Age: Age in years
Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1)
Steps
Exploratory Data Analysis: Inspect the dataset to understand the distribution of variables and the relationship between features and the target variable.
Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering: Scale the features to prepare the data for KNN and improve model performance.
Modeling & Prediction: Implement the KNN algorithm to predict diabetes.
Model Evaluation: Assess the model using metrics like accuracy, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.
Hyperparameter Optimization: Use GridSearchCV to find the optimal number of neighbors.
Final Model: Finalize the model with the best parameters and evaluate its performance.
Requirements
This project requires the following Python libraries:

pandas
